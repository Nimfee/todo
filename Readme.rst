The Todo package
-------------------

The Todo package provides a simple Todo list.
Via a form it is possible to create tasks (ToDos). It is not possible to send an empty field. In
addition, a todo is limited to 255 characters.
All added tasks are displayed in a list. It is possible to mark a task as done. It is also possible to
reset a finished task. The list shows all tasks by default. It is possible at any time to delete tasks or
to edit the description.

By pressing 'Undo' you'll mark task as 'undone'.
By pressing 'Done' you'll mark task as 'done'.

May be installed as 'task/todo'
